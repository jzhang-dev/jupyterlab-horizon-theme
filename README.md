## Installation

- PyPI
```bash
pip install jupyterlab-horizon-theme
```

- npm
```bash
jupyter labextension install @mohirio/jupyterlab-horizon-theme
```

This theme works best with Chromium based browsers.

To get the same looks as the screenshot, create a shortcut with any browser
and tick "Open As Window", you'll have an "Almost" standalone JupyterLab app.

## Issues
Please report any issues you might have and I'll try to get it fixed as soon as possible.
