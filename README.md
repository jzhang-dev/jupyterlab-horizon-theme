## Dependencies

- JupyterLab (â©¾ 3.0)
- Node.js

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jzhang-dev/jupyterlab-horizon-theme
```

This theme works best with Chromium based browsers.

To get the same looks as the screenshot, create a shortcut with any browser
and tick "Open As Window", you'll have an "almost" standalone JupyterLab app.
